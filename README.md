# DHBW-Swift-Lecture
**Version 1.0.0**

A project for my University that should show some features of ARKit.
It is based on [this](https://github.com/thisIsTheFoxe/UIViewController-in-ARKit) idea - to display a fully functioning ViewController in AR.

## Requirements: 
To use ARKit (and consequently this project) you need iPhone SE, iPad Pro or iPad 5th gen. or later with at least iOS 11.
>  *ARKit requires an iOS device with iOS 11 and an A9 processor or later.

## How to use it:
0. Make sure you are in an open, well lit enviroment with a lot of textures (e.g. it might not work in an entirely white room). Also try to avoid any changes in enviroment (e.g. outside when it's windy,  shaddows etc.)
1. When opening the app for the first time you will be asked to allow camera access in order to use AR. After that it might take a few seconds to set up the AR enviroment.
2. Once everything is initialized, you should see a "plane" ~50cm "in front of you (on your device)". It's a ViewController with a scoll view and an image. And on the right side of it there should be an item (a white cube, per default). The image on the ViewController shows you what the item looks like.
3. You should be able to interact with the ViewController and its components. By doing so you can change the color, size and even the form of the item that's displayed. You can also make it dis- and re-appear as well as rotate it along all it's three axis.
4. **Remember: This is an open AR enviroment. You can move around and look at the items from all different angles and positions. If you have trouble navigating the ViewController, consider moving closer towards it...**
